"""Read the user's own mail into the intake, through a credential it never holds.

The counterpart to `ingest_slack.py`, and deliberately the same shape: a
bounded read, a watermark per folder, exit codes that say what went wrong, and
a credential that is a placeholder inside the sandbox. What the collector sees
in `MS_GRAPH_ACCESS_TOKEN` is `openshell:resolve:env:…`, sixty-odd bytes of
nothing; the OpenShell gateway substitutes the real delegated token at the
egress boundary and refreshes it on its own schedule. So a compromised
collector leaks a string that is useless off this host.

Delegated `Mail.Read` covers the signed-in mailbox and nothing else. This reads
the Inbox folder only: mail the user filed elsewhere is mail they have already
triaged, and an assistant that re-raises it is working against them.

Bodies are requested as text rather than HTML. A mail body in HTML is mostly
markup, and the store would hold several kilobytes of layout per message for
the sake of a paragraph the model actually reads.

    python3 ingest_graph.py            # incremental
    python3 ingest_graph.py --recheck  # re-probe the mailbox identity

Exit codes are the contract `select_intake.py` reads:

    0  collected, or never configured
    1  something else went wrong
    2  the credential is missing, wrong, or refused
    3  rate limited before the work finished
    4  the token works but lacks the scope this needs
