"""Turn source API responses into `items` rows.

Kept separate from the HTTP calls on purpose: normalization is where the
mistakes live, and this way it can be tested against recorded payloads with no
credentials and no network.

Both sources answer the same questions in different vocabulary, and this module
is where that translation is pinned down:

    Graph message id            -> source_id
    "<channel>:<ts>"            -> source_id          (a Slack ts is unique
                                                       only within a channel)
    parentFolderId / channel id -> scope
    conversationId / thread_ts  -> thread_ref
    receivedDateTime / ts       -> event_at           (ISO-8601 UTC; Slack
                                                       sends an epoch float)
    To recipient / im or mpim   -> addressing=direct
    @-mention in a channel      -> addressing=mentioned
    Cc only / channel broadcast -> addressing=broadcast
