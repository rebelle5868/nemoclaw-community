"""Clear message bodies once they are old enough, and keep everything else.

A store that judges what arrives has no reason to hold the text of it
indefinitely. What stays useful is the record — who wrote, when, what was
decided and why — and that lives in the obligation and its events, not in the
message body. So the body ages out and the history does not.

The line is deliberate. Clearing the body leaves:

- the item row, with sender, subject, timestamp, addressing and state
- the obligation, with the title the judging turn wrote
- every event, with its actor and its before/after

and removes only the sentence somebody typed. A month later the user can still
see that Dana asked for the cutover window on the third, that it was ranked
high because the memory said they had chosen that work, and that they ignored
it on the fifth. They cannot re-read Dana's exact words, which is the point.

`body_cleared_at` marks the difference between a body that was cleared and one
that never existed — a join notice and a message somebody wrote both leave
`body` NULL, and only one of them is a loss.

    python3 retention.py            # clear anything past the window
    python3 retention.py --dry-run  # report what would go, change nothing
