# What is kept, and how to be rid of it

Four controls, all of them local, none of them requiring a connector. They
work on the fixture corpus today, which is how they are tested, and they apply
unchanged to real messages when a connector lands. That order is deliberate:
the controls ship before the thing that would need them.

Every command below runs from `profile/scripts/`, against the store belonging
to the profile named by `HERMES_HOME`.

## Bodies age out; the record does not

`retention.py` runs daily at 02:00 and clears the text of anything past the
window. Thirty days by default:

```bash
python3 retention.py --dry-run   # what would go, nothing changes
python3 retention.py             # clear it
RETENTION_DAYS=7 python3 retention.py
```

Set `RETENTION_DAYS` in the job's environment to change the schedule's window
rather than a single run's. Values below 1 or above 3650 are refused: a zero
would clear the message that arrived a minute ago, and a negative one would
put the cutoff in the future and clear everything ever stored. Both are the
kind of mistake found only afterwards.

What a cleared row keeps:

| Kept | Gone |
| --- | --- |
| sender, subject, timestamp, addressing, state | the message body |
| the obligation and the title the judging turn wrote | |
| every event, with its actor and its before and after | |

So a month later you can still see that Dana asked about the cutover on the
third, that it ranked high because the memory said you had chosen that work,
and that you ignored it on the fifth. You cannot re-read Dana's words. That is
the intended line, not a limitation of the implementation.

`subject` stays with the metadata. On email it is often the only
human-readable handle a row has, it is what the obligation title came from,
and it is short enough that keeping it is not keeping the message.

`body_cleared_at` records that a body was cleared. Without it a message
somebody wrote and a join notice that never had a body are the same row —
`body IS NULL` — and only one of them is a loss.

## Some things are never written at all

Rules live in `$HERMES_HOME/workspace/exclusions.json`:

```json
{
  "senders":  ["recruiter@agency.example", "U01RECRUIT"],
  "domains":  ["agency.example"],
  "channels": ["C0SALARY01", "D0PRIVATE1"]
}
```

A sender matches `sender` — a display name or an address, depending on the
source — and also the raw id when the collector knows one, so a Slack user can
be excluded by `U…` rather than by a name they can change. A domain matches
the part after `@`. A channel matches `scope`, which is the mail folder or the
Slack channel id.

Matching is case-insensitive and exact. There are no globs: a pattern language
here is a way to exclude more than intended by accident, and the failure is
silent — nothing arrives, and nothing says why.

The rules are applied in `insert_items`, the one function every writer passes
through, rather than in any collector. So an excluded message is never written
by the fixture loader, by the Slack collector when it lands, or by anything
added later, without each of them having to remember — and a new writer cannot
quietly opt out. Filtering at display would leave the text on disk, which is
no use to somebody excluding their doctor.

A dropped message is reported on stderr as a count, never as content:

```
exclusions: 2 message(s) not stored
```

A malformed `exclusions.json` yields no rules rather than an error. The
direction is deliberate: a typo must not silently halt collection, and the
consequence — a message arriving that the user meant to exclude — is visible
to them, where a stalled pipeline would not be.

## Take a copy

```bash
python3 export_store.py              # to ./export-<date>/
python3 export_store.py --to ~/out
```

Writes `store.md` and `store.json` side by side — the first to read, the
second to process — and copies the memory and the learned preference policy
whole. Nothing is summarised and nothing is omitted; an export that quietly
left something out would answer the question wrongly.

A body cleared by the retention pass appears as `text cleared <timestamp>`
rather than as an empty line, so the export distinguishes the same two cases
the schema does.

## Be rid of all of it

```bash
python3 reset.py --dry-run
python3 reset.py --yes
```

Removes the store, the memory, the learned policy and the collection
bookkeeping, and reports each. It refuses without `--yes`, and if any part
cannot be removed it says so and exits non-zero — a reset that half worked
must not read as one that worked. The policy goes with the rest because it
encodes what its subject ignores, which is about them.

The credential is not removed, because it was never held here: it lives with
the OpenShell gateway. `reset.py` prints the commands to revoke it, since
somebody withdrawing consent wants both and would otherwise stop after the one
that felt complete.

## Where the guarantee is weaker

For Microsoft Graph, an item deleted at the source is tombstoned locally and
its body cleared at once, because the delta query reports deletions
explicitly.

Slack offers no such notice. A deleted message stops appearing in
`conversations.history`, and its absence from a bounded, paginated read cannot
be told apart from it lying outside the window. Reliable notice needs the
Events API, which this design does not use; the legacy RTM API carries the
event too, but Slack states that granular-permission apps cannot use it and
that classic apps can no longer be created. So Slack content ages out on the
scheduled pass rather than at the moment of deletion. That is the weaker
guarantee, stated rather than implied.

## Upgrading a store that predates this

`body_cleared_at` arrived with schema v2. An existing v1 store is brought
forward in place:

```bash
python3 migrate.py
```

The column is added if it is absent and the version is recorded; running it
twice does nothing the second time. `schema-v1.sql` is kept beside
`schema.sql` as the frozen text of what actually shipped, so the migration is
tested against the real prior state rather than against the current schema
with a column removed.
