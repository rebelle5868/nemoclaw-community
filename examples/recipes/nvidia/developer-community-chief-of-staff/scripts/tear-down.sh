# Default scope: the per-sandbox state — sandbox itself + the providers
# scoped to it. Host services from 00-host-services.sh (phoenix, postgres,
# github-etl, forums-etl, postgrest, plus minio + atif-export-relay when
# ATIF_EXPORT_MODE=relay) keep running, since they're typically
# long-lived across multiple bring-ups.

# Opt-in flags (mutually exclusive):
#   --stop-host-services    also stop the extras stack (phoenix, postgres,
#                            ETLs, postgrest, and storage if enabled);
#                            volumes preserved.
#   --purge-host-services   also stop the extras stack AND remove its
#                            named volumes (source-etls-postgres-data,
#                            github-etl-state). DESTRUCTIVE: forces ETL
#                            re-scrape on next bring-up.

# Gateway is never destroyed automatically — run
